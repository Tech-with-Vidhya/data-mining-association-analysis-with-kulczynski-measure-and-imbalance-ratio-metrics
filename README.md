# data-mining-association-analysis-with-kulczynski-measure-and-imbalance-ratio-metrics
This project is delivered as part of my Masters in Big Data Science (MSc BDS) Program for the module named “Data Mining” in Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), London, United Kingdom.  This project covers the Implementation of the Association Analysis using the “Supermarket Shopping Transactions” dataset.   The implementation is executed using Python’s libraries pandas and ‘mlxtend’ package with its key functions namely TransactionEncoder, priori and association_rules.   The solution includes extracting the frequent itemsets in the form of frozensets with the corresponding support values, derived the strong association rules between the various itemsets with additional measures based on the given specified confidence threshold, and written 2 custom python functions to compute Kulczynski measure and Imbalance Ratio metrics.  **NOTE:** Due to the data privacy and the data protection policy to be adhered by the students; the datasets and the solution related code are not exposed and updated in the GitHub public profile; in order to be compliant with the Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) policies.
